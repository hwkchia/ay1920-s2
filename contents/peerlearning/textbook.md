<panel header="## Step 7: Fixing Merge Conflicts" no-close>

<box type="info">
    Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits due to the clashes in content, 
    and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. <br><br>
    This will most likely happen when you try to edit a file someone has already edited before. 
</box>

In the event that you have merge conflicts in the file, you are required to resolve them in the event that a Lab TA 
has not done so. 

<img src = "images/MergeConflictOne.png" />

You are required to make the necessary changes so that the merge conflicts are resolved. <br> 

<box type="warning">
    Not deleting the arrows and equal signs might cause an error in the compilation process. 
</box>

<img src = "images/MergeConflictTwo.png" />

Once you are done, you can Mark this merge conflict as resolved. 

<img src = "images/MergeConflictThree.png" />

Following which, you can commit this merge.
