<panel header="## How Do I Contribute?" no-close>

You can contribute to the Piazza Forum to help your peers through the following: 

1. **Post** Questions or interesting topics about the module itself
2. Make **Contributions** by making posts, responses, followups, and comments to followups (i.e., everything)!

<box type="warning">
    You can still post anonymously under Piazza! <br>
    Even if you post anonymously, your contributions will still be tracked by Piazza under your name! <br><br> 
    In conclusion, if you are shy, you still can make contributions anonymously!
