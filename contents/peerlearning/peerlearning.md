# Peer Learning Segment 

<br>

<panel header="## What do I do here?" no-close>

Well, the main reason for the creation of this website is to facilitate Peer Learning. 

We hope to make CS2030 a more collaborative environment for CS2030 Students to learn from one another.

2. :fas-pen: Contribution via CodeCrunch Peer Learning Tasks. 
3. :fas-question: Piazza Participation.
